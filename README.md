# PS-Xstore-Tools

A collection of administrative Oracle xStore scripts written in PowerShell. These scripts are designed to help manage and configure Oracle xStore environments. They have been tested against Oracle xStore v20. The variables have been obfuscated behind an `.env` file to allow for generic use and to prevent leaking any sensitive information.
